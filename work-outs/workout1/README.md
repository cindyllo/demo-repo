This is the first work-out assignment for Stat 133!

We're going to be wrangling with data and visualization, using data about NBA players. The goal is to find a ranking for the teams, based solely on the players' stats and not on the teams' wins, losses, etc. Using just the stats (a simple variable), we'll make different observations about composite variables in order to determine a ranking! :-)
